# POCO Testing for Data API Builder

This repository contains a set of tests designed to validate the Plain Old CLR Objects (POCO) used in the **Data API Builder** project. These tests ensure that the POCOs adhere to expected structure, behavior, and data consistency.

## Overview

POCOs are simple objects without any business logic, often used to represent data structures in .NET applications. In the context of the Data API Builder, POCOs are critical in handling API data mappings between the database and service layer. This repository focuses on ensuring that these POCOs are correctly implemented, conforming to the contracts required by the Data API.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Testing**: The test suite covers:
  - Property validation (getters and setters)
  - Default value checks
  - Serialization and deserialization compatibility
  - Data annotations and validation attributes
  - Equality and hashing behavior
- **Test Data Generation**: Uses mock data generation to ensure consistency and avoid hardcoded values in tests.
- **Automated via CI/CD**: Integrated with GitHub Actions (or other CI tools) for continuous testing and validation.

## Requirements

To run the tests, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- .NET 6.0 or later
- xUnit or NUnit for unit testing
- Moq (optional, for mocking dependencies)
- AutoFixture (optional, for auto-generating test data)
- Newtonsoft.Json (for serialization tests)
